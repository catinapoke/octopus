# Octopus
Android game "Octopus" was made for GarudaGogotun's game developing part (now is [Pixel Cells](https://vk.com/pixel.cells)) in 2018th.    

This game is unrealesed(and unfinished) because of unperspective genre. Genre is runner, so there are big games like Subway Surfers, Temple Run and etc.
